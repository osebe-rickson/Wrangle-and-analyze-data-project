# Wrangle-and-analyze-data-project by Udacity
Project Motivation
Context
Your goal: wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations.

The Data
In this project, you will work on the following three datasets.

Enhanced Twitter Archive

The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text, which I used to extract rating, dog name, and dog "stage" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) to make this Twitter archive "enhanced." Of the 5000+ tweets, I have filtered for tweets with ratings only (there are 2356).
I extracted this data programmatically, but I didn't do a very good job. The ratings probably aren't all correct. Same goes for the dog names and probably dog stages (see below for more information on these) too. You'll need to assess and clean these columns if you want to use them for analysis and visualization.
Additional Data via the Twitter API

Back to the basic-ness of Twitter archives: retweet count and favorite count are two of the notable column omissions. Fortunately, this additional data can be gathered by anyone from Twitter's API. Well, "anyone" who has access to data for the 3000 most recent tweets, at least. But you, because you have the WeRateDogs Twitter archive and specifically the tweet IDs within it, can gather this data for all 5000+. And guess what? You're going to query Twitter's API to gather this valuable data.

Image Predictions File

One more cool thing: I ran every image in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive through a neural network that can classify breeds of dogs*. The results: a table full of image predictions (the top three only) alongside each tweet ID, image URL, and the image number that corresponded to the most confident prediction (numbered 1 to 4 since tweets can have up to four images).
So for the last row in that table:

tweet_id is the last part of the tweet URL after "status/" → https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/889531135344209921
p1 is the algorithm's #1 prediction for the image in the tweet → golden retriever
p1_conf is how confident the algorithm is in its #1 prediction → 95%
p1_dog is whether or not the #1 prediction is a breed of dog → TRUE
p2 is the algorithm's second most likely prediction → Labrador retriever
p2_conf is how confident the algorithm is in its #2 prediction → 1%
p2_dog is whether or not the #2 prediction is a breed of dog → TRUE etc.

## Gathering Data
**Enhanced Twitter Archive** can be downloaded from [here](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170160)

**The tweet image predictions**

This file (image_predictions.tsv) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. It is hosted on Udacity's servers and should be downloaded programmatically using the Requests library and the following [URL](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv)

**Additional data from the Twitter API**

Gather each tweet's retweet count and favorite ("like") count at the minimum and any additional data you find interesting. Using the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's Tweepy library and store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called tweet_json.txt file.

Each tweet's JSON data should be written to its own line. Then read this .txt file line by line into a pandas DataFrame with (at minimum) tweet ID, retweet count, and favorite count. Note: do not include your Twitter API keys, secrets, and tokens in your project submission.
